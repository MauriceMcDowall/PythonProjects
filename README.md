## Number Guessing
* Program in which the computer randomly chooses a number
* The user is given a hint
* Each time the user is wrong, they get another hint but their score goes down.
* Will need functions to compare the inputted number with the guessed number
* to compute the difference between the two
* and to check whether an actual number was inputed or not.
